## Neboola Technical Test 2

Second technical test for neboola created with react. List of 10 random photos from the api https://picsum.photos/ and the author of the photo, with a fixed header .

### Indications

Welcome to the second test, may the pug be with you üëãüèº

![pug](https://picsum.photos/id/1025/300/300)

This time you will have to code the following screen, only for mobile devices:

https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main/#/console/18958536/395028718/inspect

Use the following credentials if needed:
- email: miguel+testfront@neboola.studio
- password: Testfront

Using the preview mode you can check how the screen should look and using the inspect mode you'll be able to find about the implementation details (margins, font sizes, etc).

The idea is to load a random set of 10 images using a fanstastic free-to-use API called Lorem Picsum: https://picsum.photos/

1. Read the docs and discover Lorem Picsum's API.
2. Connect the API to your frontend code.
  - Use the list endpoint to get a list of 10 elements using a random page number from 10 to 30 (both included).
  - Show those images in the list and display the author's name on the card as showed in the design.

Feel free to use any client side JS framework/library but we recommend you to use React.

Focus on **performance** and **readability**. Consider any corner cases.

Write down any assumption you make.

You can share your code with us using a github repository or a google drive link. You can even deploy they project using something like github pages if you want.

Happy coding ü§ì

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
